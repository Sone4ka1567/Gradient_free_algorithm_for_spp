# Gradient_free_algorithm_for_spp
Experiments for ZOS-SEG algorithm for paper E. Statkevich et. al "Gradient-free algorithm for saddle point problems under overparametrization"

Notebook "Parameters_Fitting" contains algorithm implementation and fitting of the following parameters: batch_size B, step_size and smoothing parameter tau.

Notebook "Comparison" contains calculations of convergence rates for three different algorithms for solving Saddle point problem. Here you can see comparison results.
